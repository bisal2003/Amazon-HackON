## üö© The Problem: The Paradox of Sustainable Shopping

Despite growing eco-consciousness, consumers and businesses are trapped in a cycle of distrust, waste, and inaction.

1.  **The Greenwashing Fog:** "Eco-friendly" claims are rampant and unreliable. With **78% of green labels on Indian e-commerce being unverified** (TERI, 2024), consumers have no way to identify genuinely sustainable products, leading to widespread distrust.

2.  **The Plastic Default:** Inefficient packaging is the norm. **72% of Amazon India shipments use plastic**, contributing to an estimated **11,000 tons of plastic waste annually** (CPCB, 2024). This is not only an environmental disaster but also a massive operational inefficiency.

3.  **The Motivation Gap:** The path of least resistance is linear consumption. With over **40 million monthly returns** and **less than 5% of consumers engaging in recycling programs**, there is a clear lack of incentive. **84% of shoppers refuse to pay a premium** for sustainability without tangible rewards (BCG).

This isn't just an environmental issue; it's a **$30 billion market opportunity** in India alone (IBEF, 2027) waiting for a scalable, trustworthy solution.

## üí° The Solution: Amazon GreenX

GreenX is a suite of five specialized AI and Blockchain modules that work in concert to create a transparent, efficient, and rewarding sustainable marketplace. It's not a single monolithic AI; it's a precise, modular ecosystem built for scale and accuracy.

### Key Features

#### üîó 1. EcoChain Trace: Blockchain for Verifiable Trust
EcoChain provides an immutable, transparent ledger for product certification. It ends greenwashing by giving every eco-product a verifiable history.
*   **GreenScore‚Ñ¢:** An A++ to D grading system based on 8 key sustainability metrics.
*   **Digital Certificates:** Blockchain-verified certificates for products and sellers, accessible via QR code.
*   **Consumer Transparency:** Buyers can trace a product's entire lifecycle, from raw materials to their doorstep.

#### ‚úÖ 2. EcoSense AI: AI for Seller Validation & Fraud Detection
EcoSense automates the onboarding of genuine eco-sellers, ensuring the integrity of the GreenX marketplace.
*   **AI-Powered Verification:** Uses **AWS Rekognition** and PhotoDNA to compare seller selfies with official documents, preventing identity fraud.
*   **Secure Data Handling:** All sensitive seller data (PAN, GST) is encrypted using **AES-256 via AWS KMS**, ensuring enterprise-grade security.
*   **Route Optimization:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to suggest the most efficient logistics routes for new sellers.

#### üåç 3. CarbonKarma AI: AI for Product Carbon Footprint Analysis
CarbonKarma gives consumers real-time insight into the environmental impact of their purchases, turning abstract data into tangible motivation.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Estimates CO‚ÇÇ footprint from either a **product image** or a **text description** using a fine-tuned LLM (Gemini).
*   **Impact Dashboard:** A personal dashboard showing users their cumulative impact (e.g., "You've saved 12kg of CO‚ÇÇ this month, equivalent to planting 3 trees").
*   **Gamification:** Drives behavioral change by making sustainability a rewarding and emotionally resonant experience.

#### üì¶ 4. RePack AI: AI for Intelligent Waste Reduction
RePack AI tackles packaging waste at the source by using 3D vision to optimize packaging for every single item.
*   **3D Vision Analysis:** Uses **PyTorch3D** to create a 3D model of a product from an image, calculating the optimal box size and minimizing void space.
*   **Material Recommendation:** Suggests sustainable packaging alternatives (e.g., "Switch from bubble wrap to mushroom packaging").
*   **Smart Disposal Guides:** Generates QR codes with clear, localized instructions for recycling or composting the packaging.

#### üõçÔ∏è 5. GreenGather AI: Your Personalized AI Green Assistant
GreenGather makes sustainable shopping convenient, affordable, and engaging.
*   **AI Recommendation Engine:** Provides personalized suggestions for eco-friendly products based on user behavior and carbon impact.
*   **Group Buying:** Clusters orders by location to reduce delivery emissions and offers discounts for participation.
*   **Green Coin Economy:** A rewards system where users earn "Green Coins" for making sustainable choices, redeemable for discounts on future purchases.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

GreenX is built on a modern, scalable, and decoupled architecture. The frontend (React) communicates with a backend (Python) via a REST API, which orchestrates the various AI/ML and Blockchain services.

-   **Frontend:** A responsive React application provides a seamless user interface for all GreenX features.
-   **Backend API Gateway:** A central Python (Flask/FastAPI) application that serves as the brain, routing requests to the appropriate micro-service or AI model.
-   **AI/ML Services:** Each AI module (EcoSense, CarbonKarma, etc.) is a specialized service, allowing for independent scaling and updates.
-   **Data Layer:** A hybrid data storage approach using SQL for structured data and AWS S3 for unstructured data like images and documents.
-   **Blockchain Network:** An Ethereum-based network for managing the EcoChain Trace certifications and GreenScore‚Ñ¢.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Rationale

We chose each technology for its specific strengths in building a scalable, AI-driven, and secure platform.
